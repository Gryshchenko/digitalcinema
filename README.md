# Hypertube
This project proposes to create a web application that allows the user to research and
watch videos.
The player will be directly integrated to the site, and the videos will be downloaded
through the BitTorrent protocol.
The research engine will interrogate multiple external sources , like for
example http://www.legittorrents.info, or even https://archive.org.
Once the element selected, it will be downloaded from the server and streamed on the
web player at the same time. Which means that the player wonâ€™t only show the video
once the download is completed, but will be able to stream directly the video feed.

## Code
For client JS - React/Redux
For back-end Php/JS - Laravel/Node for streaming
